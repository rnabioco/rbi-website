   Abstract={Nonsense-mediated RNA decay (NMD) is an evolutionarily conserved RNA quality control process that serves both as a mechanism to eliminate aberrant transcripts carrying premature stop codons, and to regulate expression of some normal transcripts. For a quality control process, NMD exhibits surprising variability in its efficiency across transcripts, cells, tissues, and individuals in both physiological and pathological contexts. Whether an aberrant RNA is spared or degraded, and by what mechanism, could determine the phenotypic outcome of a disease-causing mutation. Hence, understanding the variability in NMD is not only important for clinical interpretation of genetic variants but also may provide clues to identify novel therapeutic approaches to counter genetic disorders caused by nonsense mutations. Here, we discuss the current knowledge of NMD variability and the mechanisms that allow certain transcripts to escape NMD despite the presence of NMD-inducing features.

   Abstract={Liver lymphatic vessels support liver function by draining interstitial fluid, cholesterol, fat, and immune cells for surveillance in the liver draining lymph node. Chronic liver disease is associated with increased inflammation and immune cell infiltrate. However, it is currently unknown if or how lymphatic vessels respond to increased inflammation and immune cell infiltrate in the liver during chronic disease. Here we demonstrate that lymphatic vessel abundance increases in patients with chronic liver disease and is associated with areas of fibrosis and immune cell infiltration. Using single-cell mRNA sequencing and multi-spectral immunofluorescence analysis we identified liver lymphatic endothelial cells and found that chronic liver disease results in lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) that are in active cell cycle with increased expression of CCL21. Additionally, we found that LECs from patients with NASH adopt a transcriptional program associated with increased IL13 signaling. Moreover, we found that oxidized low density lipoprotein, associated with NASH pathogenesis, induced the transcription and protein production of IL13 in LECs both in vitro and in a mouse model. Finally, we show that oxidized low density lipoprotein reduced the transcription of PROX1 and decreased lymphatic stability. Together these data indicate that LECs are active participants in the liver, expanding in an attempt to maintain tissue homeostasis. However, when inflammatory signals, such as oxidized low density lipoprotein are increased, as in NASH, lymphatic function declines and liver homeostasis is impeded.},

   Abstract={A substantial fraction of the human transcriptome is composed of the so-called long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), yet the available catalogs of known lncRNAs are far from complete. Moreover, functional studies of these RNAs are challenged by several factors, such as their tissue-specific expression and functional heterogeneity, resulting in only ca. 1% of them being well characterized. Here, we describe a set of 41,400 novel lncRNAs discovered with RNA-Seq data from 1463 samples encompassing diverse tissues and cell lines. We utilized publicly available transcriptomic and genomic data to provide their characteristics, such as tissue specificity, cellular abundance, polyA status, cellular localization, evolutionary conservation and transcript stability, which allowed us to speculate on their possible biological roles. We also pinpointed 24 novel lncRNAs as candidates for breast cancer biomarkers. The results bring us closer to a comprehensive annotation of human lncRNAs, though vast amounts of further work are needed to validate the predictions and fully decipher their biology.

   Abstract={MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are key mediators of post-transcriptional gene expression silencing. So far, no comprehensive experimental annotation of functional miRNA target sites exists in Drosophila. Here, we generated a transcriptome-wide in vivo map of miRNA-mRNA interactions in Drosophila melanogaster, making use of single nucleotide resolution in Argonaute1 (AGO1) crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) data. Absolute quantification of cellular miRNA levels presents the miRNA pool in Drosophila cell lines to be more diverse than previously reported. Benchmarking two CLIP approaches, we identify a similar predictive potential to unambiguously assign thousands of miRNA-mRNA pairs from AGO1 interaction data at unprecedented depth, achieving higher signal-to-noise ratios than with computational methods alone. Quantitative RNA-seq and sub-codon resolution ribosomal footprinting data upon AGO1 depletion enabled the determination of miRNA-mediated effects on target expression and translation. We thus provide the first comprehensive resource of miRNA target sites and their quantitative functional impact in Drosophila.},

   Journal="JCI Insight",
   Year="2019",
   Volume="5",

   Abstract={Many lung diseases result from a failure of efficient regeneration of damaged alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) after lung injury. During regeneration, AEC2s proliferate to replace lost cells, after which proliferation halts and some AEC2s transdifferentiate into AEC1s to restore normal alveolar structure and function. Although the mechanisms underlying AEC2 proliferation have been studied, the mechanisms responsible for halting proliferation and inducing transdifferentiation are poorly understood. To identify candidate signaling pathways responsible for halting proliferation and inducing transdifferentiation, we performed single cell RNA sequencing on AEC2s during regeneration in a murine model of lung injury induced by intratracheal LPS. Unsupervised clustering revealed distinct subpopulations of regenerating AEC2s: proliferating, cell cycle arrest, and transdifferentiating. Gene expression analysis of these transitional subpopulations revealed that TGFÎ² signaling was highly upregulated in the cell cycle arrest subpopulation and relatively downregulated in transdifferentiating cells. In cultured AEC2s, TGFÎ² was necessary for cell cycle arrest but impeded transdifferentiation. We conclude that during regeneration after LPS-induced lung injury, TGFÎ² is a critical signal halting AEC2 proliferation but must be inactivated to allow transdifferentiation. This study provides insight into the molecular mechanisms regulating alveolar regeneration and the pathogenesis of diseases resulting from a failure of regeneration.},

   Abstract={In the unfolded protein response (UPR), stress in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) activates a large transcriptional program to increase ER folding capacity. During the budding yeast UPR, Ire1 excises an intron from the HAC1 mRNA and the exon products of cleavage are ligated, and the translated protein induces hundreds of stress-response genes. Using cells with mutations in RNA repair and decay enzymes, we show that phosphorylation of two different HAC1 splicing intermediates is required for their degradation by the 5'â†’3' exonuclease Xrn1 to enact opposing effects on the UPR. We also found that ligated but 2'-phosphorylated HAC1 mRNA is cleaved, yielding a decay intermediate with both 5'- and 2'-phosphates at its 5'-end that inhibit 5'â†’3' decay and suggesting that Ire1 degrades incompletely processed HAC1. These decay events expand the scope of RNA-based regulation in the budding yeast UPR and have implications for the control of the metazoan UPR.},

DUX4's transcriptional activity has been extensively characterized, but the DUX4-induced proteome remains undescribed. Here, we report concurrent measurement of RNA and protein levels in DUX4-expressing cells via RNA-seq and quantitative mass spectrometry. DUX4 transcriptional targets were robustly translated, confirming the likely clinical relevance of proposed FSHD biomarkers. However, a multitude of mRNAs and proteins exhibited discordant expression changes upon DUX4 expression. Our dataset revealed unexpected proteomic, but not transcriptomic, dysregulation of diverse molecular pathways, including Golgi apparatus fragmentation, as well as extensive post-transcriptional buffering of stress-response genes. Key components of RNA degradation machineries, including UPF1, UPF3B, and XRN1, exhibited suppressed protein, but not mRNA, levels, explaining the build-up of aberrant RNAs that characterizes DUX4-expressing cells. Our results provide a resource for the FSHD community and illustrate the importance of post-transcriptional processes in DUX4-induced pathology.},

   Abstract={Communication between the 5' and 3' ends of mature eukaryotic mRNAs lies at the heart of gene regulation, likely arising at the same time as the eukaryotic lineage itself. Our view of how and why it occurs has been shaped by elegant experiments that led to nearly universal acceptance of the "closed-loop model." However, new observations suggest that this classic model needs to be reexamined, revised, and expanded. Here, we address fundamental questions about the closed-loop model and discuss how a growing understanding of mRNA structure, dynamics, and intermolecular interactions presents new experimental opportunities. We anticipate that the application of emerging methods will lead to expanded models that include the role of intrinsic mRNA structure and quantitative dynamic descriptions of 5'-3' proximity linked to the functional status of an mRNA and will better reflect the messy realities of the crowded and rapidly changing cellular environment.},

How TFIIS affects transcription under normal conditions is poorly understood. We identified backtracking sites in human cells using a dominant-negative TFIIS (TFIISDN) that inhibits RNA cleavage and stabilizes backtracked complexes. Backtracking is most frequent within 2 kb of start sites, consistent with slow elongation early in transcription, and in 3' flanking regions where termination is enhanced by TFIISDN, suggesting that backtracked pol II is a favorable substrate for termination. Rescue from backtracking by RNA cleavage also promotes escape from 5' pause sites, prevents premature termination of long transcripts, and enhances activation of stress-inducible genes. TFIISDN slowed elongation rates genome-wide by half, suggesting that rescue of backtracked pol II by TFIIS is a major stimulus of elongation under normal conditions.},

Comparative analysis of categories of target RNA binding preference, sequence preference, and transcript region specificity was performed, and identified potential posttranscriptional regulatory modules, i.e. specific combinations of RBPs that bind to specific sets of RNAs and targeted regions. These regulatory modules represented functionally related proteins and exhibited distinct differences in RNA metabolism, expression variance, as well as subcellular localization. This integrative investigation of experimental RBP-RNA interaction evidence and RBP regulatory function in a human cell line will be a valuable resource for understanding the complexity of post-transcriptional regulation.},

   Abstract={Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) methods generate sparse gene expression profiles for thousands of single cells in a single experiment. The information in these profiles is sufficient to classify cell types by distinct expression patterns but the high complexity of scRNA-seq libraries often prevents full characterization of transcriptomes from individual cells. To extract more focused gene expression information from scRNA-seq libraries, we developed a strategy to physically recover the DNA molecules comprising transcriptome subsets, enabling deeper interrogation of the isolated molecules by another round of DNA sequencing. We applied the method in cell-centric and gene-centric modes to isolate cDNA fragments from scRNA-seq libraries. First, we resampled the transcriptomes of rare, single megakaryocytes from a complex mixture of lymphocytes and analyzed them in a second round of DNA sequencing, yielding up to 20-fold greater sequencing depth per cell and increasing the number of genes detected per cell from a median of 1313 to 2002. We similarly isolated mRNAs from targeted T cells to improve the reconstruction of their VDJ-rearranged immune receptor mRNAs. Second, we isolated CD3D mRNA fragments expressed across cells in a scRNA-seq library prepared from a clonal T cell line, increasing the number of cells with detected CD3D expression from 59.7% to 100%. Transcriptome resampling is a general approach to recover targeted gene expression information from single-cell RNA sequencing libraries that enhances the utility of these costly experiments, and may be applicable to the targeted recovery of molecules from other single-cell assays.},

Leukemia stem cells (LSCs) drive the initiation and perpetuation of AML, are quantifiably associated with worse clinical outcomes, and often persist after conventional chemotherapy resulting in relapse1-5. In this report, we show that treatment of older patients with AML with the B cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) inhibitor venetoclax in combination with azacitidine results in deep and durable remissions and is superior to conventional treatments. We hypothesized that these promising clinical results were due to targeting LSCs. Analysis of LSCs from patients undergoing treatment with venetoclax + azacitidine showed disruption of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle manifested by decreased Î±-ketoglutarate and increased succinate levels, suggesting inhibition of electron transport chain complex II. In vitro modeling confirmed inhibition of complex II via reduced glutathionylation of succinate dehydrogenase. These metabolic perturbations suppress oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), which efficiently and selectively targets LSCs. Our findings show for the first time that a therapeutic intervention can eradicate LSCs in patients with AML by disrupting the metabolic machinery driving energy metabolism, resulting in promising clinical activity in a patient population with historically poor outcomes.},

While the mRNP proteome has been well characterized, little is known about mRNP organization. Using a single-molecule approach, we show that mRNA conformation changes depending on its cellular localization and translational state. Compared to nuclear mRNPs and lncRNPs, association with ribosomes decompacts individual mRNAs, while pharmacologically dissociating ribosomes or sequestering them into stress granules leads to increased compaction. Moreover, translating mRNAs rarely show co-localized 5' and 3' ends, indicating either that mRNAs are not translated in a closed-loop configuration, or that mRNA circularization is transient, suggesting that a stable closed-loop conformation is not a universal state for all translating mRNAs.},

   Abstract={Paused RNA polymerase II (Pol II) that piles up near most human promoters is the target of mechanisms that control entry into productive elongation. Whether paused Pol II is a stable or dynamic target remains unresolved. We report that most 5' paused Pol II throughout the genome is turned over within 2 min. This process is revealed under hypertonic conditions that prevent Pol II recruitment to promoters. This turnover requires cell viability but is not prevented by inhibiting transcription elongation, suggesting that it is mediated at the level of termination. When initiation was prevented by triptolide during recovery from high salt, a novel preinitiated state of Pol II lacking the pausing factor Spt5 accumulated at transcription start sites. We propose that Pol II occupancy near 5' ends is governed by a cycle of ongoing assembly of preinitiated complexes that transition to pause sites followed by eviction from the DNA template. This model suggests that mechanisms regulating the transition to productive elongation at pause sites operate on a dynamic population of Pol II that is turning over at rates far higher than previously suspected. We suggest that a plausible alternative to elongation control via escape from a stable pause is by escape from premature termination.},

In ectothermic organisms, including Drosophila and Cephalopoda, where body temperature mirrors ambient temperature, decreases in environmental temperature lead to increases in A-to-I RNA editing and cause amino acid recoding events that are thought to be adaptive responses to temperature fluctuations. In contrast, endothermic mammals, including humans and mice, typically maintain a constant body temperature despite environmental changes. Here, A-to-I editing primarily targets repeat elements, rarely results in the recoding of amino acids, and plays a critical role in innate immune tolerance. Hibernating ground squirrels provide a unique opportunity to examine RNA editing in a heterothermic mammal whose body temperature varies over 30°C and can be maintained at 5°C for many days during torpor. We profiled the transcriptome in three brain regions at six physiological states to quantify RNA editing and determine whether cold-induced RNA editing modifies the transcriptome as a potential mechanism for neuroprotection at low temperature during hibernation. We identified 5165 A-to-I editing sites in 1205 genes with dynamically increased editing after prolonged cold exposure. The majority (99.6%) of the cold-increased editing sites are outside of previously annotated coding regions, 82.7% lie in SINE-derived repeats, and 12 sites are predicted to recode amino acids. Additionally, A-to-I editing frequencies increase with increasing cold-exposure, demonstrating that ADAR remains active during torpor. Our findings suggest that dynamic A-to-I editing at low body temperature may provide a neuroprotective mechanism to limit aberrant dsRNA accumulation during torpor in the mammalian hibernator.},

   Abstract={During development in the thymus, invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells commit to one of three major functionally different subsets, iNKT1, iNKT2, and iNKT17. Here, we show that T cell antigen receptor (TCR) signal strength governs the development of iNKT cell subsets, with strong signaling promoting iNKT2 and iNKT17 development. Altering TCR diversity or signaling diminishes iNKT2 and iNKT17 cell subset development in a cell-intrinsic manner. Decreased TCR signaling affects the persistence of Egr2 expression and the upregulation of PLZF. By genome-wide comparison of chromatin accessibility, we identify a subset of iNKT2-specific regulatory elements containing NFAT and Egr binding motifs that is less accessible in iNKT2 cells that develop from reduced TCR signaling. These data suggest that variable TCR signaling modulates regulatory element activity at NFAT and Egr binding sites exerting a determinative influence on the dynamics of gene enhancer accessibility and the developmental fate of iNKT cells.},

   Abstract={RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) regulate every aspect of RNA metabolism and function. There are hundreds of RBPs encoded in the eukaryotic genomes, and each recognize its RNA targets through a specific mixture of RNA sequence and structure properties. For most RBPs, however, only a primary sequence motif has been determined, while the structure of the binding sites is uncharacterized.\\ We developed SSMART, an RNA motif finder that simultaneously models the primary sequence and the structural properties of the RNA targets sites. The sequence-structure motifs are represented as consensus strings over a degenerate alphabet, extending the IUPAC codes for nucleotides to account for secondary structure preferences. Evaluation on synthetic data showed that SSMART is able to recover both sequence and structure motifs implanted into 3'UTR-like sequences, for various degrees of structured/unstructured binding sites. In addition, we successfully used SSMART on high-throughput in vivo and in vitro data, showing that we not only recover the known sequence motif, but also gain insight into the structural preferences of the RBP.\\ SSMART is freely available at https://ohlerlab.mdc-berlin.de/software/SSMART_137/.\\ Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

   Abstract={Transcription elongation rate influences cotranscriptional pre-mRNA maturation, but how such kinetic coupling works is poorly understood. The formation of nonadenylated histone mRNA 3' ends requires recognition of an RNA structure by stem-loop-binding protein (SLBP). We report that slow transcription by mutant RNA polymerase II (Pol II) caused accumulation of polyadenylated histone mRNAs that extend past the stem-loop processing site. UV irradiation, which decelerates Pol II elongation, also induced long poly(A)+ histone transcripts. Inhibition of 3' processing by slow Pol II correlates with failure to recruit SLBP to histone genes. Chemical probing of nascent RNA structure showed that the stem-loop fails to fold in transcripts made by slow Pol II, thereby explaining the absence of SLBP and failure to process 3' ends. These results show that regulation of transcription speed can modulate pre-mRNA processing by changing nascent RNA structure and suggest a mechanism by which alternative processing could be controlled.},

Here, we present DRUID (for determination of rates using intron dynamics), a new computational pipeline that is robust, easy to use, and freely available. Our pipeline uses endogenous introns to normalize time course data and yields reproducible half-lives, even with data sets that were otherwise unusable. DRUID can handle data sets from a variety of organisms, spanning yeast to humans, and we even applied it retroactively on published data sets. We anticipate that DRUID will allow broad application of metabolic labeling for studies of transcript stability.},

   Abstract={RNA repair enzymes catalyze rejoining of an RNA molecule after cleavage of phosphodiester linkages. RNA repair in budding yeast is catalyzed by two separate enzymes that process tRNA exons during their splicing and HAC1 mRNA exons during activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR). The RNA ligase Trl1 joins 2',3'-cyclic phosphate and 5'-hydroxyl RNA fragments, creating a phosphodiester linkage with a 2'-phosphate at the junction. The 2'-phosphate is removed by the 2'-phosphotransferase Tpt1. We bypassed the essential functions of TRL1 and TPT1 in budding yeast by expressing "prespliced," intronless versions of the 10 normally intron-containing tRNAs, indicating this repair pathway does not have additional essential functions. Consistent with previous studies, expression of intronless tRNAs failed to rescue the growth of cells with deletions in components of the SEN complex, implying an additional essential role for the splicing endonuclease. The trl1Î” and tpt1Î” mutants accumulate tRNA and HAC1 splicing intermediates indicative of RNA repair defects and are hypersensitive to drugs that inhibit translation. Failure to induce the unfolded protein response in trl1Î” cells grown with tunicamycin is lethal owing to their inability to ligate HAC1 after its cleavage by Ire1. In contrast, tpt1Î” mutants grow in the presence of tunicamycin despite reduced accumulation of spliced HAC1 mRNA. We optimized a PCR-based method to detect RNA 2'-phosphate modifications and show they are present on ligated HAC1 mRNA. These RNA repair mutants enable new studies of the role of RNA repair in cellular physiology.},

   Abstract={All mRNAs are bound in vivo by proteins to form mRNA-protein complexes (mRNPs), but changes in the composition of mRNPs during posttranscriptional regulation remain largely unexplored. Here, we have analyzed, on a transcriptome-wide scale, how microRNA-mediated repression modulates the associations of the core mRNP components eIF4E, eIF4G, and PABP and of the decay factor DDX6 in human cells.\\ Despite the transient nature of repressed intermediates, we detect significant changes in mRNP composition, marked by dissociation of eIF4G and PABP, and by recruitment of DDX6. Furthermore, although poly(A)-tail length has been considered critical in post-transcriptional regulation, differences in steady-state tail length explain little of the variation in either PABP association or mRNP organization more generally. Instead, relative occupancy of core components correlates best with gene expression.\\ These results indicate that posttranscriptional regulatory factors, such as microRNAs, influence the associations of PABP and other core factors, and do so without substantially affecting steady-state tail length.},

   Abstract={Disruption of posttranscriptional gene regulation is a critical step in oncogenesis that can be difficult to observe using traditional molecular techniques. To overcome this limitation, a modified polyadenylation site sequencing (PAS-seq) protocol was used to generate a genome-wide map of alternative polyadenylation (APA) events in human primary breast tumor specimens and matched normal tissue. This approach identified an APA event in the PRELID1 mRNA that enhances its steady-state level and translational efficiency, and is a strong breast cancer subtype-dependent predictor of patient clinical outcomes. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that PRELID1 regulates stress response and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in a cell type-specific manner. Modulation of PRELID1 expression, including its posttranscriptional control, appears to be a common stress response across different cancer types. These data reveal that PRELID1 mRNA processing is an important regulator of cell type-specific responses to stress used by multiple cancers and is associated with patient outcomes.Implications: This study suggests that the regulation of PRELID1 expression, by APA and other mechanisms, plays a role in mitochondrial ROS signaling and represents a novel prognostic factor and therapeutic target in cancer.

   Abstract={In animal embryos, control of development is passed from exclusively maternal gene products to those encoded by the embryonic genome in a process referred to as the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT). We show that the RNA-binding protein, ME31B, binds to and represses the expression of thousands of maternal mRNAs during the Drosophila MZT. However, ME31B carries out repression in different ways during different phases of the MZT. Early, it represses translation while, later, its binding leads to mRNA destruction, most likely as a consequence of translational repression in the context of robust mRNA decay. In a process dependent on the PNG kinase, levels of ME31B and its partners, Cup and Trailer Hitch (TRAL), decrease by over 10-fold during the MZT, leading to a change in the composition of mRNA-protein complexes. We propose that ME31B is a global repressor whose regulatory impact changes based on its biological context.},

Here, using human CDK7 analog-sensitive (CDK7as) cells, we observed reduced capping enzyme recruitment, increased pol II promoter-proximal pausing, and defective termination at gene 3' ends upon CDK7 inhibition. We also noted that CDK7 regulates chromatin modifications downstream of transcription start sites. H3K4me3 spreading was restricted at gene 5' ends and H3K36me3 was displaced toward gene 3' ends in CDK7as cells. Mass spectrometry identified factors that bound TFIIH-phosphorylated versus P-TEFb-phosphorylated CTD (versus unmodified); capping enzymes and H3K4 methyltransferase complexes, SETD1A/B, selectively bound phosphorylated CTD, and the H3K36 methyltransferase SETD2 specifically bound P-TEFb-phosphorylated CTD. Moreover, TFIIH-phosphorylated CTD stimulated SETD1A/B activity toward nucleosomes, revealing a mechanistic basis for CDK7 regulation of H3K4me3 spreading. Collectively, these results implicate a CDK7-dependent "CTD code" that regulates chromatin marks in addition to RNA processing and pol II pausing.},

However, regulation of local protein synthesis in developing axons remains poorly understood. Here, we uncover a novel role for the actin-regulatory protein Mena in the formation of a ribonucleoprotein complex that involves the RNA-binding proteins HnrnpK and PCBP1 and regulates local translation of specific mRNAs in developing axons. We find that translation of dyrk1a, a Down syndrome- and autism spectrum disorders-related gene, is dependent on Mena, both in steady-state conditions and upon BDNF stimulation. We identify hundreds of additional mRNAs that associate with the Mena complex, suggesting that it plays broader role(s) in post-transcriptional gene regulation. Our work establishes a dual role for Mena in neurons, providing a potential link between regulation of actin dynamics and local translation.},

   Abstract={Greater than 50% of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancers coexpress the progesterone receptor (PR), which can directly and globally modify ER action to attenuate tumor growth. However, whether this attenuation is mediated only through PR-ER interaction remains unknown. To address this question, we assessed tumor growth in ER/PR-positive patient-derived xenograft models of breast cancer, where both natural and synthetic progestins were found to antagonize the mitogenic effects of estrogens. Probing the genome-wide mechanisms by which this occurs, we documented that chronic progestin treatment blunted ER-mediated gene expression up to 2-fold at the level of mRNA transcripts. Unexpectedly, <25% of all ER DNA binding events were affected by the same treatment. The PR cistrome displayed a bimodal distribution. In one group, >50% of PR binding sites were co-occupied by ER, with a propensity for both receptors to coordinately gain or lose binding in the presence of progesterone. In the second group, PR but not ER was associated with a large fraction of RNA polymerase III-transcribed tRNA genes, independent of hormone treatment. Notably, we discovered that PR physically associated with the Pol III holoenzyme. Select pre-tRNAs and mature tRNAs with PR and POLR3A colocalized at their promoters were relatively decreased in estrogen + progestin-treated tumors. Our results illuminate how PR may indirectly impede ER action by reducing the bioavailability of translational molecules needed for tumor growth. Cancer Res; 77(18); 4934-46. ©2017 AACR.},

   Abstract={UPF1 is an RNA helicase that orchestrates nonsense-mediated decay and other RNA surveillance pathways. While UPF1 is best known for its basal cytoprotective role in degrading aberrant RNAs, UPF1 also degrades specific, normally occurring mRNAs to regulate diverse cellular processes. Here we describe a role for UPF1 in regulated protein decay, wherein UPF1 acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase to repress human skeletal muscle differentiation. Suppressing UPF1 accelerates myogenesis, while ectopically increasing UPF1 levels slows myogenesis. UPF1 promotes the decay of MYOD protein, a transcription factor that is a master regulator of myogenesis, while leaving MYOD mRNA stability unaffected. UPF1 acts as an E3 ligase via its RING domain to promote MYOD protein ubiquitination and degradation. Our data characterize a regulatory role for UPF1 in myogenesis, and they demonstrate that UPF1 provides a mechanistic link between the RNA and protein decay machineries in human cells.},

   Abstract={The cellular response to genotoxic stress is mediated by a well-characterized network of DNA surveillance pathways. The contribution of post-transcriptional gene regulatory networks to the DNA damage response (DDR) has not been extensively studied. Here, we systematically identified RNA-binding proteins differentially interacting with polyadenylated transcripts upon exposure of human breast carcinoma cells to ionizing radiation (IR). Interestingly, more than 260 proteins, including many nucleolar proteins, showed increased binding to poly(A)+ RNA in IR-exposed cells. The functional analysis of DDX54, a candidate genotoxic stress responsive RNA helicase, revealed that this protein is an immediate-to-early DDR regulator required for the splicing efficacy of its target IR-induced pre-mRNAs. Upon IR exposure, DDX54 acts by increased interaction with a well-defined class of pre-mRNAs that harbor introns with weak acceptor splice sites, as well as by protein-protein contacts within components of U2 snRNP and spliceosomal B complex, resulting in lower intron retention and higher processing rates of its target transcripts. Because DDX54 promotes survival after exposure to IR, its expression and/or mutation rate may impact DDR-related pathologies. Our work indicates the relevance of many uncharacterized RBPs potentially involved in the DDR.},

   Abstract={Eukaryotic genes are marked by conserved post-translational modifications on the RNA pol II C-terminal domain (CTD) and the chromatin template. How the 5'-3' profiles of these marks are established is poorly understood. Using pol II mutants in human cells, we found that slow transcription repositioned specific co-transcriptionally deposited chromatin modifications; histone H3 lysine 36 trimethyl (H3K36me3) shifted within genes toward 5' ends, and histone H3 lysine 4 dimethyl (H3K4me2) extended farther upstream of start sites. Slow transcription also evoked a hyperphosphorylation of CTD Ser2 residues at 5' ends of genes that is conserved in yeast. We propose a "dwell time in the target zone" model to explain the effects of transcriptional dynamics on the establishment of co-transcriptionally deposited protein modifications. Promoter-proximal Ser2 phosphorylation is associated with a longer pol II dwell time at start sites and reduced transcriptional polarity because of strongly enhanced divergent antisense transcription at promoters. These results demonstrate that pol II dynamics help govern the decision between sense and divergent antisense transcription.},

   Abstract={Facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD) is caused by the mis-expression of DUX4 in skeletal muscle cells. DUX4 is a transcription factor that activates genes normally associated with stem cell biology and its mis-expression in FSHD cells results in apoptosis. To identify genes and pathways necessary for DUX4-mediated apoptosis, we performed an siRNA screen in an RD rhabdomyosarcoma cell line with an inducible DUX4 transgene. Our screen identified components of the MYC-mediated apoptotic pathway and the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) innate immune response pathway as mediators of DUX4-induced apoptosis. Further investigation revealed that DUX4 expression led to increased MYC mRNA, accumulation of nuclear dsRNA foci, and activation of the dsRNA response pathway in both RD cells and human myoblasts. Nuclear dsRNA foci were associated with aggregation of the exon junction complex component EIF4A3. The elevation of MYC mRNA, dsRNA accumulation, and EIF4A3 nuclear aggregates in FSHD muscle cells suggest that these processes might contribute to FSHD pathophysiology.},

   Abstract={Digestive system development is orchestrated by combinatorial signaling interactions between endoderm and mesoderm, but how these signals are interpreted in the genome is poorly understood. Here we identified the transcriptomes of Xenopus foregut and hindgut progenitors, which are conserved with mammals. Using RNA-seq and ChIP-seq we show that BMP/Smad1 regulates dorsal-ventral gene expression in both the endoderm and mesoderm, whereas Wnt/Î²-catenin acts as a genome-wide toggle between foregut and hindgut programs. Unexpectedly, Î²-catenin and Smad1 binding were associated with both transcriptional activation and repression, with Wnt-repressed genes often lacking canonical Tcf DNA binding motifs, suggesting a novel mode of direct repression. Combinatorial Wnt and BMP signaling was mediated by Smad1 and Î²-catenin co-occupying hundreds of cis-regulatory DNA elements, and by a crosstalk whereby Wnt negatively regulates BMP ligand expression in the foregut. These results extend our understanding of gastrointestinal organogenesis and of how Wnt and BMP might coordinate genomic responses in other contexts.},

   Abstract={Facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD) is caused by the mis-expression of the double-homeodomain transcription factor DUX4 in skeletal muscle cells. Many different cell culture models have been developed to study the pathophysiology of FSHD, frequently based on endogenous expression of DUX4 in FSHD cells or by mis-expression of DUX4 in control human muscle cells. Although results generated using each model are generally consistent, differences have also been reported, making it unclear which model(s) faithfully recapitulate DUX4 and FSHD biology. In this study, we systematically compared RNA-seq data generated from three different models of FSHDâ€”lentiviral-based DUX4 expression in myoblasts, doxycycline-inducible DUX4 in myoblasts, and differentiated human FSHD myocytes expressing endogenous DUX4â€”and show that the DUX4-associated gene expression signatures of each dataset are highly correlated (Pearsonâ€™s correlation coefficient, r âˆ¼ 0.75-0.85). The few robust differences were attributable to different states of cell differentiation and other differences in experimental design. Our study describes a model system for inducible DUX4 expression that enables reproducible and synchronized experiments and validates the fidelity and FSHD relevance of multiple distinct models of DUX4 expression.},

   Abstract={Haiti endures the poorest water and sanitation infrastructure in the Western Hemisphere, where waterborne diseases cause significant morbidity and mortality. Most of these diseases are reported to be caused by waterborne pathogens. In this study, we examined the overall bacterial diversity of selected source and point-of-use water from rural areas in Central Plateau, Haiti using pyrosequencing of 16s rRNA genes. Taxonomic composition of water samples revealed an abundance of Firmicutes phyla, followed by Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes. A total of 38 bacterial families and 60 genera were identified. The presence of several Klebsiella spp. (tentatively, K. pneumoniae, K. variicola and other Klebsiella spp.) was detected in most water samples. Several other human pathogens such as Aeromonas, Bacillus, Clostridium, and Yersinia constituted significantly higher proportion of bacterial communities in the point-of-use water samples compared to source water. Bacterial genera traditionally associated with biofilm formation, such as Chryseobacterium, Fusobacterium, Prevotella, Pseudomonas were found in the point-of-use waters obtained from water filters or domestic water storage containers. Although the pyrosequencing method utilized in this study did not reveal the viability status of these pathogens, the abundance of genetic footprints of the pathogens in water samples indicate the probable risk of bacterial transmission to humans. Therefore, the importance of appropriate handling, purification, and treatment of the source water needed to be clearly communicated to the communities in rural Haiti to ensure the water is safe for their daily use and intake.},

   Abstract={Pervasive transcription of the human genome results in a heterogeneous mix of coding RNAs and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). Only a small fraction of lncRNAs have demonstrated regulatory functions, thus making functional lncRNAs difficult to distinguish from nonfunctional transcriptional byproducts. This difficulty has resulted in numerous competing human lncRNA classifications that are complicated by a steady increase in the number of annotated lncRNAs. To address these challenges, we quantitatively examined transcription, splicing, degradation, localization and translation for coding and noncoding human genes. We observed that annotated lncRNAs had lower synthesis and higher degradation rates than mRNAs and discovered mechanistic differences explaining slower lncRNA splicing. We grouped genes into classes with similar RNA metabolism profiles, containing both mRNAs and lncRNAs to varying extents. These classes exhibited distinct RNA metabolism, different evolutionary patterns and differential sensitivity to cellular RNA-regulatory pathways. Our classification provides an alternative to genomic context-driven annotations of lncRNAs.},

While most loss-of-function variants are rare, a subset have risen to high frequency and occur in a homozygous state in healthy individuals. It is unknown why these common variants are well tolerated, even though some affect essential genes implicated in Mendelian disease. Here, we combine genomic, proteomic, and biochemical data to demonstrate that many common nonsense variants do not ablate protein production from their host genes. We provide computational and experimental evidence for diverse mechanisms of gene rescue, including alternative splicing, stop codon readthrough, alternative translation initiation, and C-terminal truncation. Our results suggest a molecular explanation for the mild fitness costs of many common nonsense variants and indicate that translational plasticity plays a prominent role in shaping human genetic diversity.},

   Abstract={We report that a major subpopulation of monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) contains high levels of dUTP, which is incorporated into HIV-1 DNA during reverse transcription (U/A pairs), resulting in pre-integration restriction and post-integration mutagenesis. After entering the nucleus, uracilated viral DNA products are degraded by the uracil base excision repair (UBER) machinery with less than 1% of the uracilated DNA successfully integrating. Although uracilated proviral DNA showed few mutations, the viral genomic RNA was highly mutated, suggesting that errors occur during transcription. Viral DNA isolated from blood monocytes and alveolar macrophages (but not T cells) of drug-suppressed HIV-infected individuals also contained abundant uracils. The presence of viral uracils in short-lived monocytes suggests their recent infection through contact with virus producing cells in a tissue reservoir. These findings reveal new elements of a viral defense mechanism involving host UBER that may be relevant to the establishment and persistence of HIV-1 infection.},

   Abstract={In a eukaryotic cell, each messenger RNA (mRNA) is bound to a variety of proteins to form an mRNA-protein complex (mRNP). Together, these proteins impact nearly every step in the life cycle of an mRNA and are critical for the proper control of gene expression. In the cytoplasm, for instance, mRNPs affect mRNA translatability and stability and provide regulation of specific transcripts as well as global, transcriptome-wide control. mRNPs are complex, diverse, and dynamic, and so they have been a challenge to understand. But the advent of high-throughput sequencing technology has heralded a new era in the study of mRNPs. Here, I will discuss general principles of cytoplasmic mRNP organization and regulation. Using microRNA-mediated repression as a case study, I will focus on common themes in mRNPs and highlight the interplay between mRNP composition and posttranscriptional regulation. mRNPs are an important control point in regulating gene expression, and while the study of these fascinating complexes presents remaining challenges, recent advances provide a critical lens for deciphering gene regulation.

Up to 45 % of peaks in publicly available HITS-CLIP libraries are attributable to this mispriming artifact, and the majority of libraries have detectable levels of mispriming. We also found that standard techniques for validating microRNA-target interactions fail to differentiate between artifactual peaks and physiologically relevant peaks.\\ Here, we present a modification to the HITS-CLIP protocol that effectively eliminates this artifact and improves the sensitivity and complexity of resulting libraries.},

   Abstract={Growing evidence shows that cancer cells use mRNA-binding proteins and miRNAs to posttranscriptionally regulate signaling pathways to adapt to harsh tumor microenvironments. In ovarian cancer, cytoplasmic accumulation of mRNA-binding protein HuR (ELAVL1) is associated with poor prognosis. In this study, we observed high HuR expression in ovarian cancer cells compared with ovarian primary cells, providing a rationale for targeting HuR. RNAi-mediated silencing of HuR in ovarian cancer cells significantly decreased cell proliferation and anchorage-independent growth, and impaired migration and invasion. In addition, HuR-depleted human ovarian xenografts were smaller than control tumors. A biodistribution study showed effective tumor-targeting by a novel Cy3-labeled folic acid (FA)-derivatized DNA dendrimer nanocarrier (3DNA). We combined siRNAs against HuR with FA-3DNA and found that systemic administration of the resultant FA-3DNA-siHuR conjugates to ovarian tumor-bearing mice suppressed tumor growth and ascites development, significantly prolonging lifespan. NanoString gene expression analysis identified multiple HuR-regulated genes that function in many essential cellular and molecular pathways, an attractive feature of candidate therapeutic targets. Taken together, these results are the first to demonstrate the versatility of the 3DNA nanocarrier for in vivo-targeted delivery of a cancer therapeutic and support further preclinical investigation of this system adapted to siHuR-targeted therapy for ovarian cancer.},

   Abstract={In cancer progression, proteolytic enzymes like serine proteases and metalloproteinases degrade the basement membrane enabling the tumor cells to invade the adjacent tissues. Thus, invasion and metastasis are augmented by these enzymes. Simultaneous silencing of uPA and MMP9 in breast cancer cells decreased the wound healing, migratory, invasive and adhesive capacity of the cells. After simultaneous down regulation, cells were seen to be arrested in the cell cycle. There was a remarkable increase in the expression of cell to cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin, and decrease in Vimentin and Snail expression. In addition, there was a significant decrease in the expression of the stem cell marker Oct-4. In the breast tumor samples it has been observed that, tumors, expressing higher level of uPA and MMP9, express less amount of E-cadherin. It has also been observed that few tumors also show, Vimentin positive in the ductal epithelial area. Thus, our model can help for checking the aggressive tumor invasion by blocking of uPA and MMP9. Our present observations also give the concept of the presence of aggressive epithelial cells with mesenchymal nature in the tumor micro-environment, altering the expression of EMT genes.},

   Abstract={Post-transcriptional regulation of mRNAs plays an essential role in the control of gene expression. mRNAs are regulated in ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes by RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) along with associated protein and noncoding RNA (ncRNA) cofactors. A global understanding of post-transcriptional control in any cell type requires identification of the components of all of its RNP complexes. We have previously shown that these complexes can be purified by immunoprecipitation using anti-RBP synthetic antibodies produced by phage display. To develop the large number of synthetic antibodies required for a global analysis of RNP complex composition, we have established a pipeline that combines (i) a computationally aided strategy for design of antigens located outside of annotated domains, (ii) high-throughput antigen expression and purification in Escherichia coli, and (iii) high-throughput antibody selection and screening. Using this pipeline, we have produced 279 antibodies against 61 different protein components of Drosophila melanogaster RNPs. Together with those produced in our low-throughput efforts, we have a panel of 311 antibodies for 67 RNP complex proteins. Tests of a subset of our antibodies demonstrated that 89% immunoprecipitate their endogenous target from embryo lysate. This panel of antibodies will serve as a resource for global studies of RNP complexes in Drosophila. Furthermore, our high-throughput pipeline permits efficient production of synthetic antibodies against any large set of proteins.},

   Abstract={Manipulation of protein stability with ligand-regulated degron fusions is a powerful method for investigating gene function. We developed a selectable cassette for easy C-terminal tagging of endogenous human proteins with the E. coli dihydrofolate reductase (eDHFR) degron using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. This cassette permits high-efficiency recovery of correct integration events using an in-frame self-cleaving 2A peptide and the puromycin resistance gene. PCR amplified donor eDHFR cassette fragments with 100 bases of homology on each end are integrated by homology-directed repair (HDR) of guide RNA (gRNA)-targeted double-stranded DNA breaks at the 3' ends of open reading frames (ORFs). As proof of principle, we generated cell lines in which three endogenous proteins were tagged with the eDHFR degron. When the antibiotic trimethoprim is removed from the media, each of the eDHFR-tagged proteins was depleted by >90% within 2-4 h, and this depletion was reversed by re-addition of trimethoprim. Since puromycin selection permits recovery of in-frame degron fusions with high efficiency using only 100-bp long regions of homology, this method should be applicable on a genome-wide scale for generating libraries of conditional mutant cell lines.},

   Abstract={RNA-sequencing protocols can quantify gene expression regulation from transcription to protein synthesis. Ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) maps the positions of translating ribosomes over the entire transcriptome. We have developed RiboTaper (available at https://ohlerlab.mdc-berlin.de/software/), a rigorous statistical approach that identifies translated regions on the basis of the characteristic three-nucleotide periodicity of Ribo-seq data. We used RiboTaper with deep Ribo-seq data from HEK293 cells to derive an extensive map of translation that covered open reading frame (ORF) annotations for more than 11,000 protein-coding genes. We also found distinct ribosomal signatures for several hundred upstream ORFs and ORFs in annotated noncoding genes (ncORFs). Mass spectrometry data confirmed that RiboTaper achieved excellent coverage of the cellular proteome. Although dozens of novel peptide products were validated in this manner, few of the currently annotated long noncoding RNAs appeared to encode stable polypeptides. RiboTaper is a powerful method for comprehensive de novo identification of actively used ORFs from Ribo-seq data.},

   Abstract={Most mammalian genes produce transcripts whose 3' ends are processed at multiple alternative positions by cleavage/polyadenylation (CPA). Poly(A) site cleavage frequently occurs cotranscriptionally and is facilitated by CPA factor binding to the RNA polymerase II (Pol II) C-terminal domain (CTD) phosphorylated on Ser2 residues of its heptad repeats (YS2PTSPS). The function of cotranscriptional events in the selection of alternative poly(A) sites is poorly understood. We investigated Pol II pausing, CTD Ser2 phosphorylation, and processing factor CstF recruitment at wild-type and mutant IgM transgenes that use alternative poly(A) sites to produce mRNAs encoding the secreted and membrane-bound forms of the immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chain. The results show that the sites of Pol II pausing and processing factor recruitment change depending on which poly(A) site is utilized. In contrast, the extent of Pol II CTD Ser2 phosphorylation does not closely correlate with poly(A) site selection. We conclude that changes in properties of the transcription elongation complex closely correlate with utilization of different poly(A) sites, suggesting that cotranscriptional events may influence the decision between alternative modes of pre-mRNA 3' end processing.},

RBPs control gene expression by regulating splicing, polyadenylation, editing, transport, stability, and translation of RNA. There are ~1500 RBPs encoded by the human genome and recent studies have detected ~1100 proteins directly interacting with polyadenylated RNA. Identifying the RNAs bound by RBPs will continue to provide important insights into the regulation of gene expression.},
