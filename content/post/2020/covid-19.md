Although our campus is closed to non-essential personnel, you can still make a difference in combatting COVID-19. Many of our bread-and-butter research supplies can be used by public health officials, some of our equipment can be repurposed, and our personnel can help our local community.

## Volunteering

We may need volunteers to help manage the COVID-19 emergency. 

Please fill out this [Google Form](https://forms.gle/kJLZNnPznXLq7SM76) with your expertise and contact information. We'll be in touch if we need your help.

## Other ways to help

-	**Donate blood!** Blood donations are critically short right now. We will have a blood drive at CU AMC on Monday March 23 from 11:30 to 6 pm at the Leprino building. If you are healthy and on campus, please donate! Walk-ins welcome or you can sign up at the [Vitalant website](vitalant.org).

- Check out this [compilation](https://www.curtisforaurora.com/covid19) of local food banks and other community resources, and see how you can help the most vulnerable in our community

-	**Explain the situation to your friends and communicate how they should implement social distancing.** Write to local organizations (gyms, churches, etc.) to convince them to postpone gatherings. 

-	**Take care of at-risk people in your community.** For instance, can you deliver some much-needed groceries for your elderly neighbor!
