Although our campus is closed to non-essential personnel, you can still make a difference in combatting COVID-19. Many of our bread-and-butter research supplies can be used by public health officials, some of our equipment can be repurposed, and our personnel can help our local community.

In coordination with our local testing facility at the [Colorado Department of Public Health and the Environment](https://www.colorado.gov/cdphe), we have drawn up a list of ways in which CU Anschutz scientists can act. 

## Lab Supplies

If you can help or donate supplies, please fill out this [Google Form](https://forms.gle/UBLnYPnci1JKQP7X8) so we can coordinate donations. We will reach out with more information about how and when donations will be collected.

We have made a list of lab supplies that are needed by our local testing facilities (link to list). Those items that are particularly important are in bold and at the top of the list.

Some supplies, such as RNA extraction kits, are specific to the eventual COVID-19 test used by our local public health facility. Other supplies, such as PPE, are not. Also, please note that although some supplies (such as RNA extraction kits) need to be an exact match, many (such as barrier tips) do not. We have noted these points next to each item. 

### Personal protective equipment

Supplies of N95 masks, gowns, sleeves, and gloves at CDPHE are critically low.

### Filter tips

CDPHE is using large numbers of filter tips. They need donations of Tip One or similar filter tips.

### RNA Extraction Kits

These kits are in short supply and currently rate-limiting for testing:

- QIAGEN with QIAmp DSP Viral RNA Mini Kit
- QIAGEN EZ1 Advanced XL with EZ1 DSP Virus Kit
- QIAGEN QIAcube with QIAmp DSP Viral RNA Mini Kit
- Roche MagNA Pure LC with Total Nucleic Acid Kit
- Roche MagNA Pure Compact with Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit I
- Roche MagNA Pure 96 with DNA and Viral NA Small Volume Kit

## Other ways to help

-	**If you are CLIA-certified, please let us know.** In the upcoming weeks, extra, trained personnel will be needed to increase capacity. 

-	**Donate blood!** There has been drop in blood donations, and we are now at Level 2 shortage. If you are healthy, consider donating through [Vitalant](https://vitalant.org). Blood donations will be done with appropriate precautions to prevent COVID-19 spread.

-	**Explain the situation to your friends and communicate how they should implement social distancing.** Write to local organizations (gyms, churches, etc.) to convince them to postpone gatherings. 

-	**Take care of at-risk people in your community.** For instance, can you deliver some much-needed groceries for your elderly neighbor!
