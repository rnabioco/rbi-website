Although our campus is closed to non-essential personnel, you can still make a difference in combatting COVID-19. Many of our bread-and-butter research supplies can be used by public health officials, some of our equipment can be repurposed, and our personnel can help our local community.

In coordination with our local testing facilities, we have drawn up a list of ways in which academic scientists can act. 

If you can help or donate supplies, please fill out this [Google Form](https://forms.gle/UBLnYPnci1JKQP7X8) so we can coordinate donations. We will reach out with more information about how and when donations will be collected.

## Lab Supplies

We have made a list of lab supplies that are needed by our local testing facilities (link to list). Those items that are particularly important are in bold and at the top of the list.

Some supplies, such as RNA extraction kits, are specific to the eventual COVID-19 test used by our local public health facility. Other supplies, such as PPE, are not. Also, please note that although some supplies (such as RNA extraction kits) need to be an exact match, many (such as barrier tips) do not. We have noted these points next to each item. 

## Lab Equipment 

** TBD **

## Other ways to help

-	**If you are CLIA-certified, please let us know.** In the upcoming weeks, extra, trained personnel will be needed to increase capacity. 

-	**Donate blood!** There has been drop in blood donations, and we are now at Level 2 shortage. If you are healthy, consider donating through [Vitalant](vitalant.org). Blood donations will be done with appropriate precautions to prevent COVID-19 spread.

-	**Explain the situation to your friends and communicate how they should implement social distancing.** Write to local organizations (gyms, churches, etc.) to convince them to postpone gatherings. 

-	**Take care of at-risk people in your community.** For instance, can you deliver some much-needed groceries for your elderly neighbor!
