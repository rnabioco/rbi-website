Although our campus is closed to non-essential personnel, you can still make a difference in combatting COVID-19. Many of our bread-and-butter research supplies can be used by public health officials, some of our equipment can be repurposed, and our personnel can help our local community.

In coordination with our local testing facility at the [Colorado Department of Public Health and the Environment](https://www.colorado.gov/cdphe), we have drawn up a list of ways in which CU Anschutz scientists can act. 

## Volunteering at CDPHE

We may need volunteers to help Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment manage the COVID-19 emergency. 

You must be able to work in a high stress environment, handle human samples (HIPPA) in a tissue culture hood, with full protective gear on.

We also want to know if you have CLIA/CAP certification to participate directly in sample preparation and testing.

CDPHE are short-staffed and may also be able to use volunteers to help with inventory and paperwork.

Please fill out this [Google Form](https://forms.gle/kJLZNnPznXLq7SM76) with your expertise and contact information. We'll be in touch if we need you help.

## Lab Supplies

The most current list of needed supplies is on this [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kHaE2AnRYQj_91f5Lwq891R44S9v79KMXDu-G_VkP9M/edit#gid=161763722).

If you can help or donate supplies, please fill out this [Google Form](https://forms.gle/UBLnYPnci1JKQP7X8) so we can coordinate donations. We are collecting supplies on the loading docks of RC1 South and North and will plan to make a trip to CDPHE with accumulated supplies at 12:00 PM each day as long as the campus is open.

Some supplies, such as RNA extraction kits, are specific to the eventual COVID-19 test used by our local public health facility. Other supplies, such as PPE, are not. Also, please note that although some supplies (such as RNA extraction kits) need to be an exact match, many (such as barrier tips) do not. We have noted these points next to each item. 

**NOTE**: Please do not make large purchases of supplies simply to help with the emergency. At this point it may do more harm than good. In addition, please be cognizant of donations bought with NIH funds, we may have some auditing to do later on. We have lists of donations accrued via the donation form.

### Personal protective equipment

Supplies of N95 masks, gowns, sleeves, and gloves at CDPHE are critically low.

### Filter tips

CDPHE is using large numbers of filter tips. They need donations of Tip One or similar filter tips.

### RNA Extraction Kits

These kits are in short supply and currently rate-limiting for testing:

- QIAGEN with QIAmp DSP Viral RNA Mini Kit
- QIAGEN EZ1 Advanced XL with EZ1 DSP Virus Kit
- QIAGEN QIAcube with QIAmp DSP Viral RNA Mini Kit
- Roche MagNA Pure LC with Total Nucleic Acid Kit
- Roche MagNA Pure Compact with Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit I
- Roche MagNA Pure 96 with DNA and Viral NA Small Volume Kit

## Other ways to help

-	**Donate blood!** There has been drop in blood donations, and we are now at Level 2 shortage. If you are healthy, consider donating through [Vitalant](https://vitalant.org). Blood donations will be done with appropriate precautions to prevent COVID-19 spread.

- Check out this [compilation](https://www.curtisforaurora.com/covid19) of local food banks and other community resources, and see how you can help the most vulnerable in our community

-	**Explain the situation to your friends and communicate how they should implement social distancing.** Write to local organizations (gyms, churches, etc.) to convince them to postpone gatherings. 

-	**Take care of at-risk people in your community.** For instance, can you deliver some much-needed groceries for your elderly neighbor!
