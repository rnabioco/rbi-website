RBI faculty member Neelanjan Mukherjee, PhD is one of five new Boettcher Investigators.


This year is the 10th class to receive research funding through the
Boettcher Foundation's Webb-Waring Biomedical Research Awards program.

The awards support promising, early career scientific researchers, allowing them
to establish their independent research and make it competitive for major
federal and private awards. Recipients are awarded $235,000 in grant funding to
sustain up to three years of biomedical research.

This year's class brings the total number of CU-based Boettcher
Investigators to 44, representing research awards of $10.2 million.
