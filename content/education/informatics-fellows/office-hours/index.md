The RBI Informatics Fellows are here to help. Bring us broken scripts and software glitches.

## Office Hours

The RBI Informatics fellows hold weekly RBI office hours on Thursdays from 1-4 PM. These office hours were initiated to allow investigators across campus to ask questions about the design, execution, and analysis of RNA-related sequencing experiments. 

**Office hours are held in RC1 South room 9101 (in the fishbowl)**

### 1-2pm open for walk-in help 
  
### 2-3pm 15 min scheduled meetings

Due to demand we have set aside scheduled time for meetings. Please email us to reserve a time slot. We have scheduled these times to be 15 minutes, but can be extended depending on availability. 
  
### 3-4pm single cell RNA-seq experimental design consultations

These times are reserved for meetings to discuss experimental design related to single cell RNA-seq. Please email us to schedule a time.
