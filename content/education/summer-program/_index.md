A hands-on, mentored research opportunities in RNA biology, chemistry,
biochemistry, genomics, and bioinformatics.

The RNA Bioscience Initiative (RBI) at the University of Colorado School of
Medicine in the Denver metro area offers a summer research internship program in
the areas of RNA Biology, Chemistry, Biochemistry, Genomics, and Bioinformatics.
Interns are matched with one of the faculty from the biomedical research
departments on the campus, including researchers studying fundamental aspects of
biology and the molecular bases of cancer, developmental biology, autoimmunity,
and infectious disease. Undergraduate students with a strong interest in RNA
research are encouraged to apply for this program. The program is especially
intended for undergrads wishing to gain more research experience in advance of
applying to graduate school. Applicants may designate three preferred potential
mentors from RBI faculty or they may contact an RBI faculty member ahead of
applying to pre-arrange an internship match (please note this on the
application).

The RNA Bioscience Initiative was started with a $20 million award from the
University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus in 2016. The mission of the RBI
is to create and expand a vibrant center of discovery and innovation in RNA
research, diagnostics and therapy. Our goal is to provide a fluid pipeline from
basic to clinical RNA research on our campus and beyond. 

Important information:

- 10-week program, from early June through early August (start and end dates flexible). $4,000 stipend.

- Round-trip travel to Denver and housing are provided to our interns.

- Starting in Summer 2020, 50% of interns will be selected from [SACNAS](sacnas.org)-affiliated students.

- Opportunities for hands-on research expericnece in the lab of a research mentor on one of a broad range of cutting-edge RNA research projects.

- An orientation day to the RNA Bioscience Initiative and Internship Program.

- Weekly RNA-related small group lunch seminars from core RBI faculty.

- Mentoring lunches with PhD students and postdocs affiliated with the RBI.

- A short oral presentation at the end of the project to develop science speaking skills.

- Spend the summer in Denver, CO, which offers a great balance of urban and outdoor activities.
