The RBI is soliciting applications for our next round of pilot awards. This set
of awards will be focused around new single-cell technologies we have already
developed, or would like to develop in collabobration with local groups.

We are hosting a seminar on March 3, 2020 describing these new technologies so that you can think
about how to apply them to your own questions. We will describe single-cell
approaches to probe:

1. **Receptor-ligand interactions that control gene expression**. We and others have established a workflow for scoring receptor-ligand interactions in single-cells. We hope to collaboratively apply this tool to study receptor:ligand interactinos that control organismal development, specificity in the immune system, and cell cycle control deregulated in cancer.

1. **Tracking Molecular dissemination in animals**. We developed an approach to track the distribution of molecules in animals using single-cell sequencing to understand the cell-type specificity and impacts of delivered molecules in vivo.

1. **Single-cell lineaging**. New methods can track the development of an initial cell or cell population using DNA barcoding strategies and single-cell RNA sequencing. The RBI plans to invest in these new technologies and is looking to partner with researchers interesting biological applications. 

We also have ideas to combine single-cell mRNA-sequencing with long-reading
sequencing for analysis of full-length mRNA isoforms and viral RNAs, or to
expand the capabilities of multi-modal single-cell mRNA-seq to analyze diverse
cellular phenotypes.
