The goals of the Regulatory RNA group are to identify and elucidate new RNA regulatory mechanisms with the goal of examining these RNAs in basic biology and disease, bringing these discoveries into the clinic whenever possible.

The Regulatory RNA Group within the RNA Bioscience Initiative is grounded in investigation of the molecular mechanisms that regulate RNA biogenesis and the mechanisms by which non-coding RNAs exert control over an ever-expanding number of cellular activities, ranging from translation to chromatin modification to genome editing. 

Faculty participatng in the Regulatory RNA group currently have primary appointments in several departments and divisions in the School of Medicine.
