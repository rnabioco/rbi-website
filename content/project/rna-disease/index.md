The goals of the RNA and Disease group are to identify and define the contribution of RNA to disease including viral and other pathogens.

Errors in RNA processing and maturation can lead to human disease. Increasingly errors in splicing, tRNA and snoRNA maturation, and other aspects of metabolism are identified that lead to disease. Viral and other pathogen RNAs play key roles in infection and regulation of host metabolism. Analyses of RNA in disease may provide new insights into the roles of RNA in biology and new avenues for disease treatment. Faculty participating in the RNA and Disease group currently have their primary homes in five different departments and medical divisions of the School of Medicine.
