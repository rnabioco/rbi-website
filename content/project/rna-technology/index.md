The goals of the RNA Technology and Informatics section are to develop and improve methods to analyze RNA diversity, nascent transcription, sequence, and structure; and to create new computational methods to support these analyses.

New RNA technologies and computational methods fuel new discoveries to advance the field of RNA biology. Recent advances include:

- RNA analysis from complex cell populations and single cells.
- Improved methods for analysis of non-coding RNAs, nascent transcription, RNA chemical modifications, RNA 5' and 3'  end modification and RNA structure.
- Improved computational approaches to support large-scale RNA sequencing efforts
