 abstract = {Transcription elongation rate influences cotranscriptional pre-mRNA maturation, but how such kinetic coupling works is poorly understood. The formation of nonadenylated histone mRNA 3' ends requires recognition of an RNA structure by stem-loop-binding protein (SLBP). We report that slow transcription by mutant RNA polymerase II (Pol II) caused accumulation of polyadenylated histone mRNAs that extend past the stem-loop processing site. UV irradiation, which decelerates Pol II elongation, also induced long poly(A)+ histone transcripts. Inhibition of 3' processing by slow Pol II correlates with failure to recruit SLBP to histone genes. Chemical probing of nascent RNA structure showed that the stem-loop fails to fold in transcripts made by slow Pol II, thereby explaining the absence of SLBP and failure to process 3' ends. These results show that regulation of transcription speed can modulate pre-mRNA processing by changing nascent RNA structure and suggest a mechanism by which alternative processing could be controlled.},
