 abstract = {Disruption of posttranscriptional gene regulation is a critical step in oncogenesis that can be difficult to observe using traditional molecular techniques. To overcome this limitation, a modified polyadenylation site sequencing (PAS-seq) protocol was used to generate a genome-wide map of alternative polyadenylation (APA) events in human primary breast tumor specimens and matched normal tissue. This approach identified an APA event in the PRELID1 mRNA that enhances its steady-state level and translational efficiency, and is a strong breast cancer subtype-dependent predictor of patient clinical outcomes. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that PRELID1 regulates stress response and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in a cell type-specific manner. Modulation of PRELID1 expression, including its posttranscriptional control, appears to be a common stress response across different cancer types. These data reveal that PRELID1 mRNA processing is an important regulator of cell type-specific responses to stress used by multiple cancers and is associated with patient outcomes.Implications: This study suggests that the regulation of PRELID1 expression, by APA and other mechanisms, plays a role in mitochondrial ROS signaling and represents a novel prognostic factor and therapeutic target in cancer.
