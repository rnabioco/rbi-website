 abstract = {Every step in the life cycle of an RNA transcript provides opportunity for regulation. One important aspect of post-transcriptional control is the regulation of RNA stability. Of the many strategies for determining mRNA stability, transcription inhibition and metabolic labeling have proved the most amenable to high-throughput analysis and have opened the door to dissecting mRNA decay transcriptome-wide. Here, we describe experimental and computational methods to determine transcriptome-wide RNA stabilities using both pharmacological inhibition of transcription and metabolic labeling. To aid in the analysis of these experiments, we discuss key characteristics of high-quality experiments and address other experimental and computational considerations for the analysis of mRNA stability. Broader application of these approaches will further our understanding of mRNA decay and illuminate its contribution to different biological processes.},
